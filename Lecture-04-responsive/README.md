# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Applied basic typography for readability (font, line-height, headings)
- Styled the page structure with spacing, layout constraints, and colors
- Added responsive images and improved visual hierarchy

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- body
- header, footer
- section
- img
- nav a / a:hover

## One thing I struggled with
- Choosing colors that look good together while keeping good readability and contrast

## One improvement I want to do next
- Improve the layout further and experiment with more advanced responsive design techniques
